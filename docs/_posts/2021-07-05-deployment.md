Run <kbd>jekyll build</kbd> as usual, and `jekyll-vite` will take care of running
Vite.js to compile assets.

_GitHub Pages_ does not support all Jekyll plugins, so you will need to build or
host it in a different serviceâ€”such as _[Netlify]_, where this site is [hosted].

Remember to install all npm packages that are necessary to build the frontend assets.
