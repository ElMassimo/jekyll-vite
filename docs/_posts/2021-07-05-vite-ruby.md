[<kbd>jekyll-vite</kbd>][gem] is powered by _[Vite Ruby]_, which provides additional [guides] and a [configuration reference].

It also [demonstrates] how to configure [Vite plugins] such as [<kbd>vite-plugin-windicss</kbd>][windicss] and [<kbd>vite-plugin-components</kbd>][components], which greatly improve the authoring experience of styles and Vue components respectively.

## Why Vite? ü§î

[Jekyll] does not have an extensible asset pipeline, which limits the amount of
integrations that exist for different languages and preprocessors. By default,
assets are not fingerprinted which is problematic for caching.

[Vite.js] has an extensible architecture and is built on top of [rollup.js], and as
a result there is an active ecosystem of plugins and tooling available. In addition,
it's [no bundling] design provides a very fluid authoring experience‚Äîchanges to
your assets are reflected instantly in your browser.
